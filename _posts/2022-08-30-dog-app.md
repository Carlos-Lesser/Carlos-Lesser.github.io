title: Dog Breed Image Classification App!
---
As part of my final project for Brainstation's Data Science Bootcamp, I built a Dog Breed Image Classifcation App using InceptionV3.
I was able to reach an accuracy score of 88% and deployed an app.

I used Resnetv30 for my model, please visit [Dog Breed Image Classification Notebook](https://github.com/Carlos-Lesser/dog_app) on GitHub.
