title: Dog Image Classification App!
---
I created a Dog Breed Image classifcation App using Transferlearning with Accuracy of 88%.![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/dog1.PNG)

I used Resnetv30 for my model, please visit [Dog Breed Image Classification Notebook](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.

Please visit and try the [Dog Breed Classification App](https://carlos-lesser-dog-app-dog-app-38wto4.streamlitapp.com/) on Streamlit.





Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/dog1.PNG)
