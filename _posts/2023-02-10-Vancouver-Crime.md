title: Vancouver Crime Analysis with Tableau!
---
As part of my final project for Brainstation's Data Science Bootcamp, I built a Dog Breed Image Classifcation App using InceptionV3.
I was able to reach an accuracy score of 88% and deployed an app. In this post you would be able to use the app and get more details on my project.
