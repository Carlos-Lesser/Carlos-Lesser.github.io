I’m passionate about building relationships and helping others solve problems. I take pride in negotiating contracts that mutually benefits both parties. Knowledge is power and I decided to expand my expertise by doing a data science diploma. This has given me the tools to use data to tell a story and be able to provide a clear and precise argument when negotiating contracts. In my free time, I coach runners and train for marathons. My favorite part is building relationships with my athletes’ and helping them achieve their goals.
