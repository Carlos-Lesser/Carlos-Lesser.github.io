In 2022, I got out of my comfort zone and I decided to pursue a new career in data science. I’m passionate about data science, especially considering how quickly technology is changing all industries. I enjoy using data to find new innovative solutions.

In my free time, I coach runners and train for marathons. I often look at my athletes’ data as well as my own to find new ways to improve my performance and theirs. Data follows me everywhere and I am passionate about maximizing how I can use it to my best advantage.
